# Biology 610: Scientific programming for biologists

This purpose of this course is to introduce graduate students to core concepts in programming using the Python language.
Students are **not required** to have any previous experience with programming-- if you do have previous experience
consider this an excellent opportunity to practice "[Beginner's mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshin)". 
The course will be taught in an interactive, workshop-like environment where we will go over code together.
This environment will benefit the active participant, so please do you best during class to concentrate on the
material at hand rather than blowing it off until later (even if Andy is terribly boring).
Below is the tentative schedule for the course. Depending on the speed we go through topics there might
be shifts in the schedule.

### January 6. Getting Python going on your machine

Installing anaconda, jupyter notebooks, python baby steps

### January 8. Python programming language

Printing, data structures, indexing

### January 10. Python language continued

Control flow, conditionals, looping, functions. Assignment 1 handed out.

### January 13. Numpy and Scipys

Using numpy and scipy to boost our productivity. ndarrays, indexing, etc.

### January 15.  Matplotlib, plotting data

Basics of matplotlib, histograms, scatterplots, making things pretty.
