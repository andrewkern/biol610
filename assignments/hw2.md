# Homework Assignment 2
As with HW 1, please turn this assignment in as a jupyter notebook. This homework will
be due next Wednesday.

Question 1 and it's subparts rely upon a dataset that is in the class github repo under
assignments called `populations.txt`. Please be sure to update your version of the repo to get this small dataset

**Question 1:** Using numpy and matplotlib, import the `populations.txt` dataset. Next complete the following tasks:
1) describe the mean and standard deviation of each of the population sizes in the dataset.
2) write a function to find the species which is most abundant in each year.
3) plot the population sizes of hares, lynxes, and carrots as a function of time (i.e. x-axis will be year). Ideally your plot will use a different 
color for each species and will include a legend.


**Question 2:** Using pandas, import the insect egg database and try to do the following: Reproduce the plot of volume to aspect ratio (called ar in the column values) shown [here](https://shchurch.github.io/dataviz/index.html). See if you can color points according to length as done on that webpage.
