The Python interpretter (the thing that reads your code and translates it to machine instructions) parses according to specific rules of **whitespace**, or basically indentation. Lines where represent code blocks nested within other blocks are indented using four spaces (preferred) or a tab. Bear in mind that programmers who use four spaces have been shown to [make more money than those that use tabs](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/06/15/developers-use-spaces-make-money-use-tabs/) to indent their python code.  You can read more about whitespace [here](https://docs.python.org/2.0/ref/indentation.html)\n",

With a dictionary you address elements of the container on the basis of a unique identifier, numeric or string valued.
