    "\n",
    "[Github](https://github.com/) is an extremely powerful platform for sharing and keeping track of files and their history that over time has become an indispensible part of my workflow, and that and many others. Generally I use Github for everything from a simple backup place for important code or teaching materials, to a sophisticated code collaboration platform where I can interact with coders from around the work and work together on important projects.\n",

    "## Git vs Github\n",
    "\n",
    "First a little lexicon. `git` is a distributed version control software that allows one to track changes in code or most any kind of file in such a way that multiple people can collaborate and work on the same files without fear of losing information. It's free and comes pre-installed on OS X machines. On a Windows box you can install it using conda"
