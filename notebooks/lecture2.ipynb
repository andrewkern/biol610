    "## Strings\n",
    "It is worth spending a bit of effort on strings as 1) they come up a lot and 2) there are a whole variety of built in functions that python allows you to use on strings. Strings can be declared using single or double quotes. Likewise backslash escapes work within both single and double quoted strings -- e.g. \\n \\' \\\". A double quoted string  can contain single quotes without any issues (e.g. \"I didn't do it\") and similarly single quoted string can contain double quotes.\n",

    "## Slicing strings\n",
    "A really convenient thing with python strings is our ability to slice them up to get out substrings. The same ideas are implemented for lists. For instance consider the the string `s = 'Hello'`\n",
    "<img src=\"files/hello.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "* `s[1:4]` is `'ell'` -- chars starting at index 1 and extending up to but not including index 4\n",
    "* `s[1:]` is `'ello'` -- omitting either index defaults to the start or end of the string \n",
    "* `s[:]` is `'Hello'` -- omitting both always gives us a copy of the whole thing (this is the pythonic way to copy a sequence like a string or list)\n",
    "* `s[1:100]` is `'ello'` -- an index that is too big is truncated down to the string length \n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively Python allows us to index from the *back* of strings/lists using negative indices. For instance\n",
    "\n",
    "* `s[-1]` is `'o'` -- last char (1st from the end)\n",
    "* `s[-4]` is `'e'` -- 4th from the end\n",
