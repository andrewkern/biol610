    "# Simulation-- Genetic Drift\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture we are going to do something a bit different: rather than focus on individual bits of code and learning about tools we will try to put our new found skills to a particular use. In this case we will be learning about one of the most important forces in evolution-- genetic drift. \n",
    "\n",
    "Genetic drift, by definition, is the stochastic (i.e. random) changes in the frequency of alleles in a population induced by the finite size of a population. However, the strength of drift depends on the size of the population, as a simple exercise in coin tossing will illustrate. In ten tosses you might easily get seven heads; in 1000 tosses, however, you would nearly never get 900 heads with a \"fair\" coin. \n",
    "\n",
    "The same sort of random fluctuation in allele frequencies can occur in small populations. A classic setup is the Urn Problem, in which we consider an urn full of red and black marbles each in equal frequency; we fill a new urn with marbles sampled from the first urn by choosing a marble at random, placing *a copy* into the new vessel, and replacing the original (what we call in the business *sampling with replacement*). A small sample of marbles will probably not equal the frequencies of red and black as in the original urn. This is akin to the random samples that determine the frequency of an allele in a new population. A second small sample will randomly shift the frequency to yet another frequency. If instead large samples of marbles are taken from the original urn (akin to large population size) then the frequency would be maintained more exactly in the next generation. This sampling process of marbles is roughly equivalent to the sampling process of alleles between generations, what we will call Genetic drift. \n",

    "**Exercise-** explain in a sentence why genetic drift is said to be a stronger force in small populations.\n"

    "A quick aside before we go any further. To initialize our population of $A_1$ and $A_2$ alleles we will want to use a Bernoulli random number generator. A Bernoulli random variable, call it $x$ is an r.v. which only takes the values $1$ or $0$ representing *sucess* and *failure* of an event to occur respectively, and call the probability of success, $p$. We say that $x \\sim Ber(p)$ if $Prob(x = 1) = p$ and $Prob(x = 0) = 1-p$.\n",

Fixation is when all alleles in the population are $A_1$; this necessarily implies loss of the $A_2$ allele (\"fixation\" or \"loss\" should only be used with reference to a specific allele). If each population starts at $p = 0.5$, then at the end, when all populations have lost their variation, 50% of the populations will be fixed for the $A_1$ allele and 50% will be fixed for the $A_2$ allele (latter = \"loss\" for the $A_1$ allele, get it?).

Let the probability of flipping our coin and getting a heads be $P(head) = p$ and the probability of a tails be $P(tails) = 1 - p$.
